# linkgrabber
This is a chrome extension that adds functionality to app.pluralsight.com to make it easier and faster to make lists of links in Google Sheets. 

This is really only useful to me and like 4 other people in the world. 

To use, save all files in a folder and add that folder to chrome as an unpacked extension. 
It will add a textarea and two buttons to the pages of app.pluralsight.com. Use alt+rmb to click on links to add them to the list. 
Click "copy" to copy them to the clipboard, then paste straight into google sheets. 
Click "clear" to empty the list.
